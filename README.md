# function-and-conditionals
Just a discovery of projects with logical sequencing and everyday computations
# example 1
# With this example I used a temperature calculation based on what outside temperature will likely result.

# The temperature is set variable notation is declared alongside the integer value 


# 
Example 2
This carries on with the logic of temperature based on the user's input but using the try and except clause

# try-except Block:

# #example 3
For this example I used the try-and except block as well, but for the computer graphics card.

# #Example 4
# #with this example I used a dictionary to store the value of the computer items, instead of using variables with underscores. 
# # The reason for this is that if a user inputs a string with a value with spaces, my code won't execute the code effectively.
# # It will lead to an error clause, which is the exception handling. So to stay away from this I used a dictionary to store the key and value pairs for each item. 

# #example 5
with this example, I used the function calls and dictionary to store the vst content. 

#example 6
#for this example I used American Express card as an example to showcase what will output if a user-chosen from the selections



#example 7
# My previous code works fine but to shorten it to show my enhanced skills for conditionals and functions. I simplified it like this.
